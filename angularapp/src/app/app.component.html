<div class="welcome">
  <h1>The Royal Society</h1>
  <p>Thank you for completing our recruitment home exercise.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We would like you to create a simple book display page and form to display book information.</p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>We've setup a template project for you. It includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An Angular frontend embedded in a .Net web application (All UI components should be implemented in Angular)</li>
  <li>The beginning of an API - A book API controller exists for you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected completed solution</h2>

<p>When you have completed this exercise, you should remove these instructions. There should be a very simple library management application in their stead.</p>

<p>Please remove the home component and replace it with your own, or use routing to create a link to your library management app page.</p>

<p>The application needs to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Display a list of books retrieved from https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=trees</li>
  <li>A book from the catalogue can be chosen and loaded into a basic editor.</li>
  <li>Display a form with a few fields, such as ID, Title, and Author, and display the book detail in the form when the edit button is clicked</li>
  <li> There is no need to update or introduce functionality.</li>
  <li>Please give careful consideration to the final product's aesthetics.</li>

</ul>
